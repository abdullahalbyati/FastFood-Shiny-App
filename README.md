## The Data

The data set was collected in January of 2017 by looking through online nutritional information provided by fast food restaurant chains. Nutrition data on various burgers, a breaded chicken sandwich, a grilled chicken sandwich, chicken nuggets, french fries, and a chocolate milkshake were collected for each restaurant (when applicable). For each chain the smallest hamburger, the smallest cheeseburger, and a variety of their most well known larger burgers were selected.
